A mock-up of an application, made in just two weeks, that would allow a consumer to vote with their dollar and make purchasing decisions based on the ethics of a company and its parent company.

The web-app was built in fullstack Java. 
Springboot & Hibernate plus the Spring data JPA for the backend. Testing was done in JUnit. Basic styling was done with with Bootstrap and a custom stylesheet provides more advanced styles like mediaqueries for a custom, fully responsive experience.
